Project Description
It is a console-based task manager app where users can add, complete, and view tasks.

How the Project Works
When the program runs, the user is prompted to choose one of the options (add, complete, view task, or exit the program). If the user chooses to add a task, they submit “1” and then type in the task. The user can also view the tasks. Tasks that are not completed are shown with an ❌ next to them. After the user completes a task, a ✔️ is shown next to the task when the user views the tasks.
